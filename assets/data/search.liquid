There’s a lot to the mod that may seem complicated to even more experiencedusers, but this short guide will help you get the hang of things.What is Twitch Toolkit?Twitch Toolkit is a mod by hodlhodl that allows viewers to affect the game in a number of ways. Themost prominent is its store, which allows you to purchase a number ofthings the streamer curated. Depending on the purchase, these things appear in-game or affect thegame in some way. Another way viewers can interact with the game is through the mod’s polls. Thechoices in these polls depend heavily on what’s enabled in the mod.What Are Coins?Coins are the mod’s currency. You can view your balance by using the !bal command.You’ll notice the balance command may have some new emojis. If that’s the case, here is an overviewof the emojis as follows: 💰 represents the amount of coins you current have. ⚖ represents your current karma. 📈 represents the amount of coins you gain everytime the mod awards coins. 📉 represents the amount of coins you lose everytime to mod awards coins.What is Karma?Karma is a system in the mod that tries to limit the amount of negative events a viewer can purchase atone time. This system works by directly modifying that amount of coins viewers get everytime the modawards coins. This means that the lower you karma is, the lower your coin gain is. The hope is thatnegative events get spread out more so the colony can recover.How Do I Use Twitch Toolkit?You can use Twitch Toolkit in a number of ways – the most prominent way is through itscommands. The more important command is the !buycommand, which is the mods entry point into purchasing things from the store. Other notable commandsare the !mypawn commands, which allow you see various information about your pawn. We won’t coverevery command here, but most commands should generally be self-descriptive or have a description ofwhat they do on the commands page." }, { "title" : "Mod List", "category" : "", "tags" : " ", "url" : "/itemlist/modlist", "date" : "N/A", "excerpt" : "Mod NameAuthorVersion Harmony Andreas Pardeike2.3.1.0 HugsLib UnlimitedHugs11.0.3 ...", "content" : "Mod NameAuthorVersion Harmony Andreas Pardeike2.3.1.0 HugsLib UnlimitedHugs11.0.3 ToolkitCore nry1.0.0.0 Twitch Toolkit nry2.0.10.0 [NL] Dynamic Portraits Nals1.0.0.0 [KV] Don&#39;t stop the music erdelf (original) &amp; Kiame (support) Allow Tool UnlimitedHugs ToolkitUtils SirRandoo7.0.4.0-beta+6fdbc22282511652e115c43e0d6c89402f88b4b5 Better Workbench Management Falconne EdB Prepare Carefully EdB Furnace Sam_ Harvest Organs Post Mortem Smuffle and OMGSplat Hospitality Orion Mad Skills Ratys2.7.0.0 Pick Up And Haul Mehni1.0.0+9f86e76c731e01a0010144331d5dc54c9b5f8a37 Progress Renderer Neptimus71.5.0 QualityBuilder Hatti1.0.18 Removable Mt.Rock Roof Patch Proxyer Reverse Commands Andreas Pardeike RT Fuse Ratys1.7.0.0 Sometimes Raids Go Wrong RemingtonRyder1.0.8884.37791 Stack XXL Indeed Tech Advancing GHXX1.0.0.0 Twitch Chat the_heye1.0.0.0 Ugh You Got Me RemingtonRyder1.0.8847.22466 Vanilla Achievements Expanded Oskar Potocki and Smash Phil1.4.8896.39236 VGP Garden Fabrics dismarzero VGP Vegetable Garden dismarzero VGP Garden Resources dismarzero VGP Garden Medicine dismarzero Trait Slots Plus Side1iner1.0.0.0 Glitter Tech Xavior1.0.0.0" },    { } {} ]
